The Korean smartphone maker LG is all set to introduce LTE TDD in six international markets including India. The company announced that it will be launching Optimus G smartphone first in Saudi Arabia through telecom operator Saudi Telecom Company (STC).
Post this LG, plans to release its LTE TDD-enabled smartphones in other markets such as China, India, North America, Japan and Australia, within this calendar year. It is noteworthy that LG first started testing LTE TDD service in partnership with China Mobile at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2013.

"LTE TDD is a superior alternative in some countries due to its flexibility in uploading and downloading content," said Dr. Jong-seok Park, President and CEO of the LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company. "We're excited to offer consumers LTE TDD capable smartphones based on our unparalleled knowhow in 4G LTE technologies. With the commercial introduction of LTE TDD service, LG will build upon its expertise in 4G LTE by offering future device options utilizing this standard."

4G in India has not really taken off so far and there are very limited smartphones supporting LTE TDD available in India. So this may turn out to be a good move by LG to address a gap in the market.

LG has recently been very aggressive in terms of introducing new smartphones in India. It has recently launched LG Optimus L3 and LG Optimus L5 in India. Both these smartphone are entry-level smartphones.

Priced at Rs. 7,199, LG Optimus L3 II comes with 3.2-inch QVGA IPS display. It houses a 1,540mAh battery. Other specs on the Optimus L3 II Dual include a 1GHz single core processor with 512MB of RAM, 4GB of internal storage and a 3.2-megapixel fixed focus camera. The smartphone runs on Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) out of the box along with Optimus 3.0 UI. Connectivity options include 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth and aGPS.

The LG Optimus L5 II on the other hand sports a 4-inch WVGA screen with Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean on-board. It comes with a 5-megapixel rear camera with LED flash. It is available for Rs. 10,499. Internally, the device is powered by a 1GHz single core processor with 512 MB RAM. There's 4GB of internal storage and a 1,700mAh battery.
